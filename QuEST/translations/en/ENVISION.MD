# QuEST Envision

## How do we define "Framework"

*    It's something that makes decisions for me
*    A collection of coded assumptions
*    A library that calls your code and gives you an architecture
*    A collection of tools and patterns useful for the implementation of known problems
*    Pre-cooked solutions
*    Codified knowledge and experience
*    A convention
*    A solution that maps most problems
*    A work frame in which compromises were evaluated
*    a system that defines a structure on which it can be built

## Scope

Framework for software development

## Value

*    The value that the software brings
*    Life cycle related -> For the "people" use it
*    Satisfies needs over time

## What is the purpose of the Manifesto?

*    Facilitate work
*    Distill conversations
*    Generate awareness

## Principles

*    Make clear what I have to do (list of functional requirements vs NFR)
*    "No Framework" is always an option
*    Always evaluate the cost of the framework
*    Always evaluate the cost of exiting every single feature of the framework
*    The framework must be expendable
*    Learn the principles behind the framework
*    Evaluate how the team's skills can cover the features of the framework
*    Question the framework way
*    Prefer non-monolithic frameworks
*    Technical choices, made by technicians in collaboration with stakeholders
*    The framework code you choose is still your code
*    Frameworks are a source of knowledge
*    Framework as entry points (lower cognitive load for Junior)
*    Each project has its own characteristics and needs
*    The value is not in writing code but in the reason I write code
*    Do what you need
*    The criteria of technological choices must be shared by the whole team
*    Establish a convention and motivate it
*    Do not be lazy
*    Frameworkless! == Hate Framework
*    Quick! == Hurry
*    Courage (born of awareness)
*    Each solution is more or less valid in a context
*    Don't take anything for granted (Brain Driven Development)
*    Walking Skeleton
*    Simple Design (Evolutionary, Emergent)
*    Work on "The Metal"
*    Knowledge of Fundamentals
*    Be aware of the decisions I am delegating
*    Training Skills with Katas
*    Igengneria is the art of compromise
*    Look for examples of solutions in the frameworks
*    Generate Options, postpone revocable decisions
*    Question what you think you understand
*    Beware of Buzzwords
*    Respect for those who write the frameworks
*    Consider the cost of delay
*    Recognize the value of the framework
*    No Silver Bullet (not even this poster)
*    Frameworkless as appropriation and not as waste
*    Prepare for the failure of the framework
*    Ask yourself if the choice made in the past is right or not
*    Document and radiate choices
*    Knowledge of the Framework as a defense mechanism
